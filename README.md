# Form Submission System

This is a group project for the COP4331C Processes for Object-Oriented Software UCF course. We are tasked with developing a standalone application for submitting forms with file upload capabilities able to be hosted in a linux environment. Uploaded documents are to be previewable in-browser on an administrative backend for the sole superuser.
